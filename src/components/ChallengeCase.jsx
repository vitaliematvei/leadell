          THE CHALLENGE
        </h1>
        <p className="px-4">
          FlipaClip is one of the first tools and the most popular application
          in the world for creating stop-motion animation with an audience of
          over 30 million. Despite being so popular, FlipaClip has never had a
          website of its own. And we were entrusted to create a site that would
          complement this unique tool and could demonstrate the main features at
          the highest level.
          <br />
          <br />
          The task was initially difficult, as we were creating a website for a
          popular animation product. We had to deviate from some rules and
          choose a completely different tactic for the design and presentation
          of the creative concept. In essence, we combined the UX and UI stages
          in order to convey our vision to the client as best as possible. Plus,
          the presentation of the concept was designed in an interactive form.
